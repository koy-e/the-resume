PROFILE

##### I am an individual who enjoys taking on new challenges and solving problems for myself as well as others.  I measure the success of every action I take by how much it has helped another person. I aim to Gain experience of working in the real world of computer science. As a third-year student, I have limited exposure to solving real life challenges that come with working as a computer scientist.  I am confident that the opportunity to work with an organization that goes through these challenges daily would provide as much benefit to me as I would like to give to it.
